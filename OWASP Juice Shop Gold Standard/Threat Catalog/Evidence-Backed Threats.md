# Evidence-Backed Threats List

This document provides a **comprehensive, evidence-backed threat catalog** identified during the Security Design Review (SDR) and Threat Modeling exercise for the OWASP Juice Shop benchmark. Each entry maps directly to supporting artifacts, observed vulnerabilities, and realistic exploitation justifications.

## ðŸ“Š Threat Overview
- **Total Threats Identified:** 30  
- **Domains Covered:** Application & Infrastructure  
- **Risk Ratings:** Critical â†’ Low  
- **Evidence Mapping:** All threats link to design artifacts, IaC configs, and code snippets

## âœ… Key Takeaways
- **4 Critical Threats** (RCE, SQLi, Open SSH, IAM Wildcards) â†’ Require *immediate remediation*.  
- **7 High Risks** â†’ High likelihood of exploitation, often trivial.  
- **11 Medium Risks** â†’ Important for long-term hardening and defense-in-depth.  
- **8 Low Risks** â†’ Low severity, but provide reconnaissance vectors for attackers.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Prioritize remediation of **Critical + High** threats before production.  
- Enforce **IaC security policies** (Terraform + Docker hardening).  
- Establish **secure SDLC practices** (dependency scanning, JWT hardening, input validation).  
- Adopt **threat-informed defense strategy** using this list as the baseline.
