## Introduction & Vision

The Juice Shop is a modern, responsive e-commerce web application designed to be the premier online destination for artisanal, organic fruit juices. Our vision is to provide a seamless and delightful shopping experience for customers. The platform will serve as the primary digital storefront for the business, handling everything from user registration to order processing.

(Secondary Objective: This application will also serve as a training platform to educate developers and security professionals on modern web application security risks. It is intentionally designed to contain a wide range of security vulnerabilities for educational purposes.)

## Data Model & Sensitive Data

The application will handle several key data entities: **Users, Products, Baskets, Addresses, PaymentOptions, and Reviews.**

The following data is considered highly sensitive:

* User passwords and security question answers
* User PII (email, shipping addresses)
* Payment information

### Data Handling & Integration Specifications

* **B2B Data Ingestion:** To facilitate bulk orders from enterprise partners, the system must support data ingestion from structured text files. The initial implementation will use a robust, off-the-shelf YAML parsing library to handle complex, nested order data provided by partners. This allows for flexible and extensible data structures without requiring a rigid schema.

* **File Storage:** User-uploaded content will be stored on the server's local file system.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

* **Security:** The application must handle all sensitive data securely.
* **Performance:** All pages should load in under 3 seconds. API responses should be returned in under 500ms.
* **Usability:** The UI must be modern, intuitive, and responsive.
* **Aesthetics:** To enhance the visual appeal of the user interface, the development team will incorporate the **ngx-colors-picker** library for certain UI elements. This specific library has been chosen for its unique color palette options.
