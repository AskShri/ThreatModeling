## 1. Introduction & Vision

[cite_start]The Juice Shop is a modern, responsive e-commerce web application designed to be the premier online destination for artisanal, organic fruit juices[cite: 161]. [cite_start]Our vision is to provide a seamless and delightful shopping experience for customers[cite: 162]. [cite_start]The platform will serve as the primary digital storefront for the business, handling everything from user registration to order processing[cite: 163].

> **Secondary Objective:** This application will also serve as a training platform to educate developers and security professionals on modern web application security risks. [cite_start]It is intentionally designed to contain a wide range of security vulnerabilities for educational purposes[cite: 164].

* [cite_start]**Registered Customer:** A user who has created an account and logged in[cite: 167].
* [cite_start]**Administrator:** A privileged user responsible for managing the shop's content and users[cite: 168].

## 3. Feature Requirements (Epics & User Stories)

### Epic 1: User Account Management

* [cite_start]**User Story 1.1 (Registration):** *As an anonymous visitor, I want to create a new account using my email address and a password so that I can make purchases*[cite: 171].
* [cite_start]**User Story 1.2 (Login):** *As a registered customer, I want to log in with my email and password to access my account*[cite: 172].
* [cite_start]**User Story 1.3 (Password Reset):** *As a registered customer, I want to reset my password by answering my security question*[cite: 173].

### Epic 2: Product Discovery & Browsing

* [cite_start]**User Story 2.1 (View Products):** *As any user, I want to view a paginated list of all available juices*[cite: 175].
* [cite_start]**User Story 2.2 (Search Products):** *As any user, I want to use a search bar to find specific juices by name or description*[cite: 176].
* [cite_start]**User Story 2.3 (View Product Details):** *As any user, I want to click on a product to see details and customer reviews*[cite: 177].

## 4. Data Model & Sensitive Data

[cite_start]The application will handle several key data entities: `Users`, `Products`, `Baskets`, `Addresses`, `PaymentOptions`, and `Reviews`[cite: 190].

[cite_start]The following data is considered **highly sensitive**[cite: 191]:
* [cite_start]User passwords and security question answers [cite: 192]
* [cite_start]User PII (email, shipping addresses) [cite: 193]
* [cite_start]Payment information [cite: 194]

### Data Handling & Integration Specifications

* [cite_start]**B2B Data Ingestion:** To facilitate bulk orders from enterprise partners, the system must support data ingestion from structured text files[cite: 196]. [cite_start]The initial implementation will use a robust, off-the-shelf `YAML parsing library` to handle complex, nested order data provided by partners[cite: 197]. [cite_start]This allows for flexible and extensible data structures without requiring a rigid schema[cite: 198].
* [cite_start]**File Storage:** User-uploaded content will be stored on the server's local file system[cite: 199].

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* [cite_start]**Security:** The application must handle all sensitive data securely[cite: 201].
* **Performance:** All pages should load in under 3 seconds. [cite_start]API responses should be returned in under 500ms[cite: 202].
* [cite_start]**Usability:** The UI must be modern, intuitive, and responsive[cite: 203].
* [cite_start]**Aesthetics:** To enhance the visual appeal of the user interface, the development team will incorporate the `ngx-colors-picker` library for certain UI elements[cite: 204]. [cite_start]This specific library has been chosen for its unique color palette options[cite: 205].

## 6. Out of Scope

* [cite_start]Real Payment Processing [cite: 207]
* [cite_start]Inventory Management [cite: 208]
* [cite_start]Order Fulfillment & Shipping Logistics [cite: 209]
