Of course. Here is the updated draft of the **'User Stories: OWASP Juice Shop E-commerce Platform'**, which carefully implements the subtle, inferential refinements from suggestions 1, 2, 3, and 6 to test the true potential of an advanced automated security review tool.

### **User Stories: OWASP Juice Shop E-commerce Platform (Enhanced for Advanced Automated Security Review)**

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Abhishek Shrivastav
**Date:** August 12, 2025

#### **Epic 1: User Account Management**

* **User Story 1.1: New User Registration**
    * **As a** first-time visitor,
    * **I want to** create a new account using my email, a password, and a security question,
    * **So that** I can log in to make purchases and track my orders.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The registration form must include fields for email, password, password repeat, security question, and security answer.
        * The email address must be validated for correct format.
        * The password must meet minimum complexity requirements (e.g., 8 characters, at least one number, one uppercase, one special character).
        * The password and password repeat fields must match.
        * The user must select a security question from a predefined list.
        * Upon successful registration, the user is automatically logged in and redirected to the homepage.

* **User Story 1.2: User Login**
    * **As a** registered customer,
    * **I want to** log in with my email and password,
    * **So that** I can access my account and make purchases.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The login form must include fields for email and password.
        * A "Remember Me" checkbox should be available. If checked, the user's session should persist for an extended period.
        * Upon successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is issued to the client to manage the session.
        * Upon three consecutive failed login attempts for a single account, that account should be temporarily locked.

* **User Story 1.3: Password Reset**
    * **As a** registered customer who has forgotten my password,
    * **I want to** reset it by providing my email and answering my security question,
    * **So that** I can regain access to my account.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The user first enters their email address.
        * The system then presents the user's chosen security question.
        * If the user provides the correct answer, they are prompted to enter and confirm a new password.
        * The new password must adhere to the defined complexity requirements.

#### **Epic 2: Product Discovery & Browsing**

* **User Story 2.1: Product Search**
    * **As a** visitor,
    * **I want to** use a search bar to find products,
    * **So that** I can quickly locate items I am interested in.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The search bar should be prominently displayed on the homepage.
        * The search query should be performed against product names and descriptions.
        * Search results should be displayed on the main product grid.

#### **Epic 3: Shopping Basket & Checkout**

* **User Story 3.1: Manage Shopping Basket**
    * **As a** customer,
    * **I want to** add products to my basket, view the contents, and change quantities,
    * **So that** I can prepare my order for checkout.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * An "Add to Basket" button is present on all product listings.
        * The user can view their basket at any time.
        * The basket view allows users to increase or decrease the quantity of each item, or remove it entirely.
        * The total cost is updated automatically as quantities change.

* **User Story 3.2: Checkout Process**
    * **As a** logged-in customer,
    * **I want to** complete my purchase through a multi-step checkout process,
    * **So that** I can order my selected juices.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The user must be logged in to access the checkout.
        * The user can select a shipping address from their saved addresses or add a new one.
        * The user can select a payment method from their saved options or add a new one.
        * The final review page must show the complete order, including items, address, payment, and total cost, before the user confirms.
    * **Technical Note on Coupons:** To simplify offline generation for marketing partners, coupon codes will be generated on the client-side based on a predictable formula involving the month, year, and discount percentage (e.g., AUG25-10 for 10% in August 2025). The final code will be encoded for URL safety before being sent to the server.

#### **Epic 4: User Interaction & Feedback**

* **User Story 4.1: Write a Product Review**
    * **As a** customer,
    * **I want to** leave a star rating and a text review for a product,
    * **So that** I can share my opinion with other shoppers.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The review input form is available on the product details page.
        * The review consists of a star rating (1-5) and a text comment.
        * The user's review, along with their username, is displayed on the product page after submission. To improve user engagement, the display should render basic user-supplied HTML formatting (e.g., `<b>`, `<i>`, `<a>` tags) for a richer user experience.
        * To enhance user experience, the "like" button will provide an optimistic UI update, immediately incrementing the count on the client-side while the request is processed asynchronously in the background.

* **User Story 4.2: Submit Customer Feedback with Attachment**
    * **As a** user,
    * **I want to** submit feedback via a "Contact Us" form and optionally attach a file,
    * **So that** I can report issues or provide suggestions.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The form includes fields for user ID, comment, and a star rating.
        * The form allows for an optional file upload.
        * The system accepts common file types (e.g., PDF, JPG, PNG) up to a certain size limit (e.g., 5MB).
    * **Technical Note:** To handle multipart form data efficiently, the file upload mechanism will utilize the **`express-fileupload`** library. The team has validated that version **`1.1.7-alpha.3`** meets the core functional requirements for this feature.

#### **Epic 5: Administrative Functions**

* **User Story 5.1: Access Admin Section**
    * **As an** administrator,
    * **I want to** access a protected administration interface,
    * **So that** I can manage the application's content and users.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The admin section is located at a non-obvious URL path (e.g., /administration).
        * Access is strictly limited to users with the "admin" role.
        * Any attempt by a non-admin user to access this section results in an error and is logged as a security event.
